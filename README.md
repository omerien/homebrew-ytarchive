# ytarchive Homebrew tap

The main purpose of this repo is to provide a tap for a formula for [ytarchive](https://github.com/Kethsar/ytarchive). This is an updated version I've made because upstream isn't updating this.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install omerien/ytarchive/ytarchive`

Or `brew tap omerien/ytarchive` and then `brew install ytarchive`.

If you want the dev version, run `brew install omerien/ytarchive/ytarchive-dev`

If you want to install with ffmpeg (necessary to mux the final file), add --with-ffmpeg. I recommand installing it separately since it has a lot of dependencies - [here is the official download link for macOS](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/).

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
